# beancord
unfinished discord client <br>
tons of bugs and basically no features <br>
come back later

# Don't trust me because I keep joking about ratting the build? build it yourself from the source:
(instructions are for windows and im not gonna write more. cry about it. <br>

## Prerequisites

To build and run the Electron app, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node.js package manager) installed on your machine.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
`git clone https://github.com/bean-frog/beancord.git`

2. Navigate to the cloned repository directory:
`cd beancord`

3. Install the dependencies using npm:
`npm install`

## Build

To build Beancord, you can use the following command:
`npm run build`

This will create a distributable version of the app in the `build` directory, which includes the executables for various platforms (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux) along with the necessary resources.

## Run

To run beancord in development mode, you can use the following npm script:
`npm run start`

This will start Beancord and open a window with your app running inside. You can make changes to the source code and see the changes reflected in the app without rebuilding it.
